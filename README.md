# What is this?
Don't know, its a fancy hex viewer with noob-coding in it. If you are looking for a professional - type of coding and viewer(or) editor, you might wanna leave this repository.

So, it is basically based on noob-c on it, using colsole application. This is pretty much optimized for, and fairly working on OSX or linux. Actually any BASH-Like system will work.

I've ran code on windows(visual studio 15), it is still working, functional, but it just look more dirty because I didn't implemented "system(clear)" for windows. So it still works, but bit messy.
